# Homework 0

You have one week to complete this problem. This is the basic Hello, World program that we did in class, so you should have no problem. The main purpose of this homework assignment is to familiarize yourself with GitHub and Atom and how to download, complete, and upload your homeworks. Remember to 'commit' and then 'push' to send me your work.

## Skills

This homework does not cover any skills explicitly. It is merely designed to familiarize you with how homework in this class will work, as well as give you more experience working with Java in Atom.

## As always...
Make sure that you include your first and last name in the comment section at the very beginning of the Java file; if I cannot determine whose homework this is, I cannot give you credit. Make sure you push your final work before the deadline.
